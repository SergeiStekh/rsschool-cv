## Briefly About Myself:

I started my career as a frontend developer in 2019. I am very interested in developing various projects, learning new technologies and applying knowledge in practice.
Completed training at RS-School (2019-2020). 

After learning, I worked on various freelance projects, but my main passion was programming and creating a startup - a Polish language school. This project uses PHP as the backend, and React is responsible for the frontend. Now this school is working, and many people use the software solutions I wrote, which is very inspiring for new achievements.

For me, programming is not just a hobby, but also a lifestyle, a way to earn money, constant training and self-development. I want to achieve the maximum in this area, and become a truly professional developer.
